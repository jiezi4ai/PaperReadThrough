In this work, we firstprovide an analysis of the factors driving many-shot ICL, and we find that 1) many-shot performance canstill be attributed to often a few disproportionately influential examples and 2) identifying such influentialexamples (“optimize”) and using them as demonstrations to regenerate new examples (“generate\")can lead to further improvements. Inspired by the findings, we propose bridge, an algorithm thatalternates between the optimize step with Bayesian optimization to discover the influential sets ofexamples and the generate step to reuse this set to expand the reasoning paths of the examples back tothe many-shot regime automatically. On Gemini, Claude, and Mistral LLMs of different sizes, we showthat bridge led to significant improvements across a diverse set of tasks, including symbolic reasoning,numerical reasoning, and code generation.\n",

      "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to the emergence of in-context learning(ICL) as a promising new learning paradigm (Brown et al., 2020). ICL allows LLMs to learn tasksby simply being presented with a few examples within their context window. A key bottleneckfor ICL has been the supported context length of LLMs, but with advancements in novel modelarchitectures, computational infrastructures, and efficient serving methods, state-of-the-art modelssuch as Gemini (Anthropic, 2024; Reid et al., 2024) feature context windows of millions of tokens areovercoming this limitation. Such long-context LLMs open unprecedented avenues for the scaling ofICL – whereas previous LLMs were limited to processing only up to dozens of examples, current LLMscan now accommodate significantly more examples. More importantly, beyond merely supporting alonger context, it has also been shown that scaling more examples led to substantial performanceimprovements across tasks, creating a new promising paradigm known as many-shot learning (Agarwalet al., 2024; Bertsch et al., 2024).\n",

Some trade-off decisions have to be made under virtually any realistic setting. To leveragethe expanded context while controlling the cost and latency under an acceptable limit, existing workstypically investigate the experimental setting whereas many examples as costs permit are simplyrandomly sub-sampled from the pool of all available examples and dumped into the context window.As observed both in prior works (Agarwal et al., 2024) and our investigations (Fig. 1), using thesame number of examples but with different combinations of examples as demonstrations can lead to\n",

      "To address these, this paper aims to answer key research questions and proposes an effectivenovel approach. First, we analyze the factors driving the many-shot ICL in the reinforced ICL setupcommon in challenging reasoning tasks where we are provided with a labeled set of inputs andfinal labels, but the intermediate reasoning path has to be model-generated. We find that while ICLperformance often increases with the number of shots, that improvement can often be at least partiallyattributed to a much smaller subset of examples that highly disproportionately contribute to theoverall task performance – as we scale the number of examples, the probability of including theseexamples also increases. In many cases, if, however, we judiciously isolate these influential examplesfrom the rest, the “many-shot” performance can be matched or even exceeded with this sometimesextremely small subset of well-chosen examples alone while adding more examples beyond this setoften provides little benefit or even harms performance. We also argue that the findings explain someof the phenomena observed. For example, uneven influence can lead to high variance across differentcombinations of examples, whereas plateauing performance may occur when we run out of goodexamples with positive performance influences. One natural implication of these is the efficiencygains by reducing redundancy in many-shot ICL and identifying the optimized subsets. However,the natural next question to ask is whether scaling ICL examples in LLMs can still be beneficialafter using up all beneficial examples identified in the previous step. We answer affirmatively tothis: to still leverage LLMs’ long context, these optimized, high-performing examples may serve asdemonstrations to re-generate the more effective reasoning paths rationales on the train set back intothe many-shot regime, which we find to often outperform both the original many-shot examples andthe optimized examples themselves. Building on these insights, we propose Bayesian Refinement andIterative Demonstration Generation for Examples (bridge), a search algorithm based on Bayesianoptimization to improve many-shot ICL and bridges the few- and many-shot learning paradigms byautomating the “optimize” and “generate” steps above iteratively. In the “optimize” step, it framesthe problem as a combinatorial optimization task to discover the optimal set of demonstrations (i.e.,many-to-few), and in the “generate” step, it uses the optimal set as seed examples to generate moreexamples for further performance enhancement (i.e., few-to-many). We demonstrate the effectivenessof bridge on Gemini, Mistral, and Claude models across a diverse range of tasks, including symbolicreasoning, numerical reasoning, and text-to-SQL generation.\n",

For example, it is unknown whetherthe benefit is from scaling examples itself due to expanded knowledge in the context via moreexamples or because including more examples increases the probability of selecting a small subset ofdisproportionately positive examples, or a combination of the above with some task specificity. We arguethat answering this question is critical – if the benefit comes from expanded knowledge from includingmore examples, it suggests that scaling and addressing long-context understanding challenges woulddominate the end-to-end performance improvements, and future studies should aim to either include\n",

We use the Gemini 1.5 Pro (Reidet al., 2024), the state-of-the-art long-context model, to focus on several representative tasks fromthe BBH tasks. All three tasks, as shown in by the gray lines in Fig. 1, benefit from increasing numberof examples to varying degrees (in logical_deduction, the performance initially increases withthe number of examples before plateauing and decreasing; in the other two tasks, there is a noisy butnear monotonic improvement throughout) – we will test the key findings in a much more extensivecollection of tasks in Sec. 4. Given the increased emphasis of modern LLMs on problem-solving andreasoning, we primarily focus on these tasks and adopt the reinforced ICL (Agarwal et al., 2024)setup, where we assume the availability of a labeled set of inputs and final labels to be used asmany-shot demonstrations, whereas any intermediate outputs or rationales leading to the finalanswer are model-generated and modifiable (although we also conduct preliminary experimentsin alternative setups such as low-resource machine translation in App. C.4). Lastly, we primarilyfocus on the tasks with the number of available labeled data up to 150-200 samples – while modernLLMs can often accommodate even more examples in the context, we focus on this range because1) we believe it is the most practically relevant and fills an important gap that neither few-shot ICLnor supervised (parameter-efficient) fine-tuning (which usually requires hundreds to thousands of\n",

      "Whereas a conclusive test would involve enumerating and eval-uating 𝑔(·) on the power set of E with |P(E)| = 2| E|, it is clearlycomputationally intractable, and a natural simplification is whetherwe can rank the individual examples in E with some importancescoring function 𝑀(𝑒) to construct example subsets based on theexample ranking. While many possible formulations of this are pos-sible, here we define 𝑀(𝑒) based on imputed input gradient, whichis a concept used in interpretable machine learning for importanceattribution (Samek et al., 2021; Selvaraju et al., 2017; Simonyan,2013; Sundararajan et al., 2017). In our context, directly com-puting input gradient is impossible as we only assume black-boxLLMs without gradient backpropagation and 𝑔(·) is not necessarilydifferentiable. To bypass these issues, we use a sample-efficientGaussian process regressor (GPR) (Williams and Rasmussen, 1995,2006) to approximate 𝑔(·) with ˆ𝑔(·), whose input gradient ∇eˆ𝑔(𝑒)is analytically available: we first randomly sample 𝑛subsets of E togive e1:𝑛= [e1, ..., e𝑛], where each subset of examples is representedas a 𝑚-dimensional binary column vector e𝑖∈{0, 1}𝑚with e( 𝑗)𝑖= 1if the 𝑗-th example is present or 0 otherwise; we then evaluate theperformance metric of each e𝑖to obtain g1:𝑛= [𝑔(e1), ..., 𝑔(e𝑛)]. Wethen compute and average the input gradient w.r.t. each possible{𝑒𝑗}𝑚𝑗=1 ∈E to obtain an approximated marginalized importance ofeach example in E1. Finally, we sort the examples based on 𝑀(𝑒)and construct subsets at regular interval from size 1 to |E| in both as-cending and descending directions. Formally, we order {𝑒𝑖}𝑛𝑖=1 suchthat 𝑀(𝑒1) ≤𝑀(𝑒2) ≤... ≤𝑀(𝑒𝑛); the ascending and descendingsets of size 𝑡∈[1, |E|] are given by a𝑡= e1:𝑡and d𝑡= e𝑛−𝑡:𝑛respec-tively. We then evaluate 𝑔(·) on these sets and show the results inFig. 1.\n",

      "can lead to performance differences that far outweigh the effect from naïve scaling – e.g., if we establishan “exchange rate” between different example sets based on their imputed ordering, we can observethat including around top-10 examples (green lines) examples is as effective as or more effective thanthe set containing bottom-30 examples in geometric_shapes. More importantly, in both cases weobserve that the green lines, which represent an intelligent selection strategy more sophisticated thanrandom sampling, plateau far before the gray line, suggesting that it is possible to achieve comparableperformance with a much smaller number of examples: in disambiguation_qa, we find that usingfewer than 20 top examples is almost already as good as using all 42 examples whereas subsequentadditions only led to a few percent of gain, possibly within the margin of error with reshuffling(denoted by error bars on the figure). In the other tasks, we find the performance to peak muchearlier and adding more examples to the context actually led to performance deterioration. The resultssuggest 1) the fact that it is possible to match or outperform using all examples with fewer, carefullyselected examples means that intelligent example selection is still relevant even with many-shotICL, echoing findings from the recent works (Li et al., 2024b) that retrieval remains valuable forlong-context models in the RAG setup; and 2) naïvely including as many examples as possible canbe suboptimal both in terms of computing cost and performance – while it is trivially true for thetasks whose performance does not improve monotonically with the number of examples, we showthat it can even be true when it apparently does: e.g., on geometric_shapes, the near monotonicimprovement overall trend (gray line) may lead someone to conclude that it is beneficial to include asmany examples as possible, even though the green line representing intelligent selection saturatesand starts to decline earlier.\n",

      "Can we still benefit from scaling examples? Experiments above demonstrated the presence ofredundancy in many-shot ICL, revealing that using a smaller subset of examples can often reducethis redundancy without sacrificing performance. It is, however, a pruning operation that necessarilyreduce the input tokens consumed. This leads to a natural question: can we still benefit from scalingthrough expanding? For this question, it is important to recognize that under the reinforced ICL setup,while the inputs and labels in many-shot setups are fixed, the model-generated intermediate outputs,which represent reasoning paths, are modifiable. Given that these intermediate roles are shown to playa critical role in steering model behaviors (Wan et al., 2024), it is possible that examples previouslyidentified as non-important or non-beneficial may be again beneficial if the model-generated rationalescan be improved.\n",

      "Figure 3 | Overview of bridge: With a labeled dataset D, exemplified with 6 samples, at the Generationphase (left half), we generate initial examples by performing LLM inference on the inputs of D (“Q1-6”) with zero-shot prompting to obtain the initial responses “A1-6”, which include any intermediateoutputs critical for ICL (Step 1). At Step 2, consistent with reinforced ICL in Agarwal et al. (2024),we filter the responses to retain the subset of D where the LLM predicted correctly to ensure theexamples include correct reasoning steps to build E𝑘, the pool of examples at round 𝑘which form thesearch space for the subsequent Optimize step. At the Optimize step (right half), we initialize theproposed Bayesian optimizer by randomly sampling subsets e(0) ⊆E𝑘as demonstrations to be Step 3evaluated on a held-out validation dataset (D can be reused for this purpose) to obtain a performancemetric Step 4. The Bayesian optimizer (BO) is then updated with binary vector representations of ethat led to this validation performance as input and the metric itself as output and suggests a newsubset of examples to be used as demonstrations for the next step Step 5; Steps 4-5 are repeated(inner loop) until the BO budget is exhausted, after which the best evaluated set e∗𝑘is returned (Step6). This set is then used as a demonstration to generate the example pool for the next round E𝑘+1(Step 7).\n",

While effective, directly using the importance scoring approach from Sec. 2 to identifythe e∗would require us to set the optimal number of examples to select ||e∗|| as a hyperparameter,the optimal value of which is task specific. Furthermore, a key motivation for the importance-basedranking in Sec. 2 is to attribute performance to individual examples; this is, however, not required ifwe simply would like to find an optimal subset e∗. To nevertheless use the GPR surrogate in Sec. 2which has shown an impressive sample-efficient, modeling capability, we propose to use Bayesianoptimization (BO) (Frazier, 2018; Garnett, 2023), a sample-efficient black-box optimization algorithmthat has recently shown promise in combinatorial problems (Daulton et al., 2022; Wan et al., 2021);it naturally synergizes with the GP surrogate yet automatically strikes a balance between explorationand exploitation to discover e∗without requiring us to set ||e∗|| beforehand, although bridge isalso compatible with alternative methods as a drop-in replacement of the “Optimize” step, which weinvestigate in detail in App. C.1.\n",

      "BO only requires some initializing samples to warm-start (Step 3). Afterward, it guides explorationby iteratively (re)fitting a GPR with the previously observed inputs and outputs so far. Formally, atiteration 𝑡∈[1, 𝑇], we have evaluated 𝑔(·) 𝑡times at e1:𝑡= [e1, ..., e𝑡]⊤with observed values g1:𝑡.Whereas a straightforward application of BO would directly train a GP on [e1:𝑡, g1:𝑡] as inputs-outputsand perform BO with 𝑔(·) as the objective function directly, a subtle but important distinction here isthat our goal is to identify a subset e∗that, when used as demonstrations on the train set, generates tothe most effective examples on the validation set, rather to simply find the highest-performing e∗onthe validation set. While we expect the two objectives to be correlated (i.e., e that led to high validationperformance is also likely to generate better samples on the train set), we also empirically find it isdesirable to encourage e∗to have a smaller cardinality akin to a ℓ0 regularization to reduce overfittingon the validation set and to discourage memorization in subsequent generations from the previousexample set E𝑡−1 of which e∗is a subset. To achieve so, we augment the performance maximizationmax 𝑔(e) with a sparsity objective which counts the number of non-zero elements in e: min Í𝑗𝑒( 𝑗) –this transforms the problem into a bi-objective optimization problem , where instead of maximizingfor the validation performance only, we also encourage sparsity as regularization. Practically, we solvethe problem with random scalarization (Knowles, 2006; Paria et al., 2020). Specifically, as hinted inStep 7 of Algorithm 2, at each BO iteration, we first sample a random scalar 𝛽𝑡∼Unif(𝛽LB, 𝛽UB) thatdetermines the weight of the performance objective 𝑔(·) of the 𝑡-th BO iteration (the weight of thesparsity objective is given by 1 −𝛽𝑡) and {𝛽LB, 𝛽UB} denote the lower and upper bounds of the weightfor 𝑔(·) which are set to {0.25, 1} by default. With this 𝛽𝑡, we then aggregate the vector objective[𝑔(e), Í𝑗𝑒( 𝑗)] back to a scalar ℎ𝑡(e) via Tchebyshev scalarization (TCH), a theoretically well-foundedscalarization scheme common in multi-objective optimization (Bowman Jr, 1976; Chugh, 2020;Steuer and Choo, 1983) given by:\n",

We conduct experiments on an extensive collection of tasks requir-ing a different set of skills task difficulty on two Gemini 1.5 models (gemini-1.5-pro-001 andgemini-1.5-flash-001) while also testing key findings on Mistral family of models: MistralNeMo (mistral-nemo-12b) and Mistral Large (mistral-large-2407), and Claude 3.5 Sonnet:1) BIG-Bench Hard (BBH) tasks encompassing a wide range of challenging numerical reasoning,commonsense problem-solving, logical deduction and tabular reasoning tasks – we particularly focuson the subset of 16 BBH tasks where the model performances have not saturated; 2) Hendryck’sMATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021), a challenging numerical reasoning dataset; 3) GSM-Hard (Gaoet al., 2022), a more challenging variant of the classical grade-school GSM-8K (Cobbe et al., 2021)with the numbers in the questions replaced with much larger and rarer ones. To further probe theutility of many-shot learning and bridge in coding tasks, we also experiment on 4) BIRD (Li et al.,2024a), a challenging large-scale text-to-SQL generation benchmark where the LLM has to generateSQLite programs from natural language instructions that are executed on real-world databases. Forall datasets, when official train-test split is not available, we randomly split the data into train andtest splits; unless stated otherwise, a single unified train split is used both for the generation ofdemonstrations and is reused for validation (i.e., the objective of the optimize step in Algorithm 1;the test splits are held-out and only used for evaluation of the algorithm.

      "moderate improvements on BBH with Gemini Pro but no significant performance gains on MATH,GSM-Hard and BBH with Gemini Flash. Both demonstrate that optimize is an integral componentof bridge and implicitly validates the findings in Sec. 3 that many-shot performance can be drivenby few disproportionately influential examples, which constitutes a core motivation for our method.Barring some expected task-specific fluctuations, in both Tables 1 and 3, we also observe consistentand monotonic performance improvement as bridge progresses over the successive optimize andgenerate steps, eventually peaking at 2g on Gemini Pro and 2o on Gemini Flash (although theperformance difference between 2g and 2o on Gemini Flash is negligible and likely within margin oferror) – based on the overall results, we recommend stopping bridge at 2g or 2o. Interestingly, weobserve that in both cases, an additional optimize step (i.e., the 3o column) somewhat degradesperformance – our hypothesis is that as bridge progresses, the generated examples become morealigned with the optimal behavior and the degree of redundancy as we observed in Sec. 2 reduces,and it becomes more difficult to squeeze the number of examples without harming task performance– indeed, from Fig.4 where we concretely analyze the behavior of the LLM in different tasks byevaluating the LLM under random subsets of E0, ..., E2 as demonstrations in held-out splits, weobserve that the benefit from naïvely scaling examples under the base reinforced many-shot ICL(denoted by red lines) can be highly unstable across tasks: from the different subfigures of Fig. 4, wefind the performance to consistently improve with more examples (leftmost), improve then plateau(middle two figures) and even simply deteriorate with more examples (rightmost) – whereas thelatter two cases are direct manifestations that not all examples contribute positively to many-shotICL and naïvely scaling examples is suboptimal, we note that it remains true even in the former casewhere there is an apparent strong, positive correlation between number of demos and performance,as we demonstrated in Sec. 2.\n",

      "Scaling ICL. Before the advent of the long-context LLMs,early efforts in scaling ICL often studied LLMs customizedfor long context (Li et al., 2023) or required architecturalchanges assuming white-box model access (Hao et al.,2022). However, the tasks considered are often limited,e.g., to conventional, discriminative tasks like sentimentclassification rather than generative tasks as consideredin this work. Furthermore, these often study LLMs thatare merely capable of handling many examples, but theirbehavior may differ significantly to modern, natively long-context LLMs that may actively take advantage of the con-text – indeed, both these works show mixed results, evensignificant performance deterioration when scaling up thenumber of examples, a phenomenon not seen in modernlong-context LLMs like Gemini and Claude. Recent workslike Agarwal et al. (2024) and Bertsch et al. (2024), onthe other hand, reported significant gains in scaling ICLto hundreds or more examples and provided importantmotivation for our work. However, as mentioned in Sec. 2,these works primarily demonstrate the existence of thebenefit from scaling but do not focus on investigate the sources of the gain or improving the cost-effectiveness of many-shot ICL. Additionally, there have also been works focusing on applications ofmany-shot ICL to multi-modalities (Jiang et al., 2024), LLM jail-breaking (Anil et al., 2024), detecting\n",

      "Example selection and generation. bridge combines the “optimize” and “generate” steps, andthere have been existing works sharing similar high-level ideas to each of the components. First, the“optimize” step can be seen as a method to improve the data quality with pruning and selection; inthis regard, given that data quality is known to be one of the most influential factors for training LLMs(Xia et al., 2024), many previous works have utilized some flavor of pruning to remove redundantor harmful data samples at different stages of training, including pre-training (Marion et al., 2023)and instruction tuning (Xia et al., 2024). In ICL, as mentioned in Sec. 2, given the sensitivity ofLLMs to examples, there have been numerous works analyzing prompt sensitivity and proposingexample selection techniques (Lu et al., 2022; Wan et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2024b).Recent work also explored heuristic-based prompt optimization based on similarity (Liu et al., 2022;Rubin et al., 2022), diversity (Levy et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2024), uncertainty (Wan et al., 2023a,b),fairness (Zhou et al., 2024a) etc. Our “generate” step, on the other hand, aims to acquire high-qualityexamples with the LLM itself. In this area, STaR (Zelikman et al., 2022) first proposes to bootstraprationales from LLM with a small number of seed examples, followed by fine-tuning on the rationalesthat lead to correct predictions; Self-Instruct (Wang et al., 2023) bootstraps LLMs to instructiondata. The “Reinforced ICL” technique introduced in Agarwal et al. (2024), upon which this workimproves, and several recent works (Chen et al., 2023; Khattab et al., 2023; Opsahl-Ong et al., 2024)use a similar technique to acquire and refine model-generated examples for ICL. Notwithstanding thesimilarities described, there are a few crucial differences with respect to these prior works: Almostall ICL works mentioned consider the few-shot setup, where selection is made necessary due to theconstraint on the number of examples allowed in the context. However, we show that even in themany-shot setup where that constraint is relaxed and example selection is no longer a necessity, itcan still be highly beneficial for performance and efficiency. Unlike the few-shot setup, bridge istailored for the many-shot setup with design decisions inspired by findings in Sec. 2, such as theimplementation of sparsity regularization in the optimization objective to enable scaling.\n",

      "This paper focuses on understanding and enhancing the core factors underlying scaling ICL. We firstprovide an analysis of the nascent paradigm of many-shot ICL in LLMs and show that notwithstandingthe long-context abilities of LLMs, the common practice of naïvely dumping as many examples aspractically possible into the context can be both inefficient in cost and suboptimal in performance.Instead, the benefit from scaling examples can often be realized by identifying a subset of influentialexamples, and that subset can be used as demonstrations themselves to re-generate even moreexamples. Inspired by the findings, we propose bridge by automatically executing the “optimize”and “generate” steps iteratively. We demonstrate that bridge perform competitively on a wide rangeof tasks, significantly outperforming alternatives. We believe that this work builds the foundation forfuture research in many-shot ICL. First, we mainly focused on the restrictive black-box LLM setup,which is the most general and model-agnostic. However, for a more relaxed, white-box setup withaccess to LLM weights, it may be possible to perform optimization more efficiently – for example, itmay be possible to take advantage of the internal representations of the model in reducing the cost ofiterative optimization. Second, we currently focus on the “reinforced ICL” setup typical for reasoning-heavy tasks – while we have conducted experiments (e.g., low resource translation tasks) beyond thissetup, further validations on other types of tasks would be valuable. Lastly, after optimization, theexamples generated by bridge are currently static at test time, and it would also be interesting tocombine with a mechanism for sample-dependent ICL optimization to further enhance performance\n",

      "BIRD On BIRD, we randomly sample 128 samples from the train split as the unified train and validationset and use the official test set (of 1534 data points) for testing. Since BIRD is a code generationtask, the execution accuracy is computed not via a simple string match between the predicted andthe ground-truth SQLs but by actually executing both SQLs on the database provided, and a scoreof 1 is only assigned when the predicted SQL is both executable and if whose results exactly matchthe execution results from the ground-truth SQL. All data, including the databases, schemas, andground-truth gold SQL are available at the official repo: https://bird-bench.github.io undera CC BY-SA 4.0 license. With reference to Table 7, use two prompt versions for different rows. Thedirect prompt is a standard, zero-shot prompt to elicit the SQL prediction directly; it is used both forthe “Direct” row to directly extract LLM answer and is also used as the prompt template for finetuningin the different “LoRA” rows:\n",

      "• Retrieval: One popular demonstration selection method is via retrieval (Das et al., 2021; Rubinet al., 2022). Concretely, we may either use an off-the-shelf pretrained embedding model(we use the latest Gecko embedding (Lee et al., 2024) for this purpose) or tune a customizedretriever to obtain the nearest examples from an example store, typically by computing thevector embedding for each of the test queries and each of the cached demonstrations followedby a maximum inner product search (MIPS) to retrieve the top-𝑘demonstrations based oncosine similarity. Unlike the optimization-based approach where the number of examples inthe context can be determined automatically, 𝑘here is a key hyperparameter that needs to beset by the user. In this case, consider 3 different 𝑘values: 𝑘= {10, 25} where the number ofexamples is fixed, or 𝑘= All, where we use all available, correctly predicted examples – thisessentially uses the same set of examples as Reinforced ICL but in a specific, input-dependentorder: the examples are sorted in an ascending order based on the cosine similarity betweenthe embedding of the test input and the example store and the most similar examples appearsas the final demonstration that is directly concatenated to the test input.• Diversity: Another popular learning-free demonstration selection method is by selecting diverseexamples. While multiple ways to measure diversity exist, here we use the technique similarto the one used in Zhang et al. (2023) by 1) computing the embedding of all the availabledemonstrations and 2) running the 𝑘-means clustering algorithm and selecting the 𝑘exampleswhose vector embeddings are nearest to each of the 𝑘centroids. Unlike retrieval, there is noinput dependency as the clustering algorithm does not depend on the input query but similar toretrieval, 𝑘here is also a hyperparameter to be set and we again use 𝑘= {10, 25}. Note that weomit 𝑘= All, as otherwise the number of clusters would be equal to the number of examples andwe would essentially be running Reinforced ICL with all available examples as demonstrations.\n",

      "Since these demonstration selection baselines purely perform selection (i.e., the “optimize” step ofbridge) but neither the subsequent generations nor the iterative process, we first compare the BOdemonstration selection (i.e., bridge at Step 1o) against these baselines and we show the resultsin Table 11. Overall, we find that “Diversity” and “Retrieval”, regardless of their hyperparameters,perform on par or slightly worse than Reinforced ICL. While the hyperparameter choice can sometimeslead to significant differences on a per-task level, we also observe that when aggregated across the tasks,it does not lead to significant differences. On the other hand, the BO selection in bridge outperformsall these baselines. We believe there are two possible explanations leading to this outperformance.Firstly, while the heuristic-based methods have lower computational costs, key hyperparameters,such as the number of demonstrations to retrieve, need to be determined a-priori. However, as wehave shown in the main text at, for example, Fig. 4, the optimal number of demonstrations can behighly task-specific, and while iterative optimization-based selection incurs a higher cost, it is alsocapable of optimizing the number of demonstrations. Secondly, a key finding we have in Sec. 2 isthat not all examples are equally helpful, and removing some examples as in-context demonstrationscan sometimes lead to performance improvement during the “Optimize” stage. Again, while theheuristic-based approaches do not necessarily use all demonstrations, it makes the selection choicepurely from a heuristic metric (e.g., similarity to test query) rather than from a validation metric, andhence is incapable of removing these potentially “harmful” demonstrations from the pool of candidateexamples.\n",

      "Additional comparisons against iterative reinforced ICL in a restricted setup.To provide furtherevidence emphasizing the need for the “Optimize” step and to make sure that the additional gain ofbridge does not simply come from the fact that bridge may take advantage of more correctlypredicted demonstrations in the validation set due to repeated sampling in the later iterations, weconduct a further experiment comparing bridge and iterative reinforced ICL, but in a restrictedsetup with the support set restricted to the subset of the train set where the model predictedcorrectly initially, instead of the entire train set. In other words, in subsequent iterations of bridgeand iterative reinforced ICL, both methods are restricted to make use of the subset of the train setinitially predicted correctly only as examples; we term these approaches “iterative reinforced ICL(restricted)” and “bridge (restricted)” respectively, and we show the results in Table 10. On a highlevel, we found the result provides further evidence of the importance of selection: Iterative Reinf ICL(restricted) without the \"optimize\" step actually did not meaningfully improve over standard ReinfICL (average accuracy: 79.6%); bridge (restricted), however, still meaningfully improves with thesubsequent optimize and generate steps, although the gain is less than the original bridge whichutilizes more examples via the larger train set support.\n",

We assume theaccess to 100 labeled examples as D and 50 unlabeled examples U, and hold out another 400samples as the test set. We use Gemini Flash as the target model and Gemini Pro as the generatormodel in Algorithm 3, and we show the result in Table 15. Overall, we observe that running iterativeoptimization also improves performance on this task, both exemplified by improvement on the testand validation chrf score, although it seems that an additional optimization round, in this case, led toa small performance degradation. While a more comprehensive evaluation is required, we believe thepreliminary result is promising for future efforts in this direction.\n",

We find that whereas the demonstrationsgenerated from (iterative) reinforced ICL led to a small deterioration of GSM-8K performance, wefound the transferred demonstrations from bridge led to a small improvement even though theGemini 1.5 Pro performance on GSM-8K has been rather saturated. While optimizing directly onGSM-8K unsurprisingly led to the highest performance given that there is no distribution shift, wealso find that the GSM-Hard demonstrations exhibit considerable generalizability.\n",
